This program builds with a standard "g++ -o exe file" call but there is an included makefile.


There are a couple options.

1) You can use "make run FILENAME={file_to_run}" to build and run the program called "CoinChange"
   replacing {file_to_run} with the name of your coin file without extensions.

   Ex.-"make run FILENAME=coins"     To build CoinChange then run coins.txt.


2) You can just use default "make" to build the program "CoinChange". Then you can run it using 
   "./CoinChange" and the name of the file without extensions.

   Ex.-"make"
      -"./CoinChange coins"          To build CoinChange then run coins.txt
